## Description
An excellent README is essential for repository, but formatting a top-notch README can take away valuable time from coding new projects.  That's why I made this handy README generator: it allows you to put in all the info you need to for a great README right from your command line. Then the program will generate a properly formatted README with all the essentials.  With this generator, you will be sure to always have a sharp looking README and save valuable time for writing your code. 
    
## Installation
To install this generator, you can run it out of VS Code, through the command line.  You will need to install a package.json and be sure to install the proper version of "Inquierer". I wrote this program with version 8.2.0, so to be sure it functions properly, I reccomend sticking to that version.  For the rest, you can copy paste my index.js into your working folder. I would copy paste my .gitignore file, too.  

## Usage Info
Once you have your package.json and Inquierer installed via your npm command, you can type `node index.js` into your command line to run the program. Answer each question, but don't worry too much about perfection: you can always touch it up after the README is generated.
