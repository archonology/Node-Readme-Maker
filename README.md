## About

An excellent README is essential for repository, but formatting a top-notch README can take away valuable time from coding new projects.  That's why I made this handy README generator: it allows you to put in all the info you need for a great README right from your command line. Then the program will generate a properly formatted README with all the essentials.  

With this generator, you will be sure to always have a sharp looking README and save valuable time for writing more code. 

*This README was generated with my Pro README Generator*

## Install


To install this generator, you can run it out of VS Code, through the command line.  You will need to install a package.json and be sure to install the proper version of `Inquirer`. I wrote this program with version 8.2.0, so to be sure it functions properly, I recommend sticking to that version.  For the rest, you can copy paste my `index.js` into your working folder. I would copy paste my `.gitignore` file, too.  

## Usage

Once you've cloned this repo or created your fork and pulled it down to your local machine:
1. Run `npm install` in your command line. Make sure your terminal is open inside the root file of the project's folder.
2. 

Once you have your `package.json` and `Inquirer 8.2.0` installed via your npm command, you can type `node index.js` into your command line to run the program. Answer each question fully, but don't worry too much about perfection: you can always touch it up after the README is generated. 

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this application, you may:
1. Create a fork of the repository.
2. Check the Issues tab in my repository to see if there is anything flagged to be completed or fixed.
3. Work your coding magic.
4. Push up your work when it works, and make a pull request. Please include a detailed note of what you added or changed and why.

If it all looks good, you can expect gratitude and a happy merging.
