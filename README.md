## Description
I wanted a cool way to generate README files for projects because they are very important, and it takes a long time to format them. With a nice README generator like this one I made, making a pro README is super easy and fun!
    
## Installation
To install this project, you will need a package.json and inquierer (version 8.2.0) to run the script. That means you will need VS Code, too, or a similar software with access to your computer's command line.

## Usage Info
run the program with `node index.js` from the project folder in your command line. You will then be prompted to answers all the questions needed to generate your pro README file.
