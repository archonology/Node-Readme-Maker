## About

An excellent README is essential for repository, but formatting a top-notch README can take away valuable time from coding new projects.  That's why I made this handy README generator: it allows you to put in all the info you need for a great README right from your command line. Then the program will generate a properly formatted README with all the essentials.  

With this generator, you will be sure to always have a sharp looking README and save valuable time for writing more code. 

*This README was generated with my Pro README Generator*

## Usage

Once you've cloned this repo or created your fork and pulled it down to your local machine:
1. Run npm install in your command line. Make sure your terminal is open inside the root file of the project's folder.
2. Run npm start in your terminal.
3. Answer the questions to complete the Inquirer prompt.
4. Upon answering all the questions, you will see your response logged in the command line.
5. Check the dist folder in the project: that is where your new README.md has been printed.

**Important:** make sure to copy your new README before creating another one in the terminal. The README.md will be overwritten each time a new Inquierer prompt is completed.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this application, you may:
1. Create a fork of the repository.
2. Check the Issues tab in my repository to see if there is anything flagged to be completed or fixed.
3. Work your coding magic.
4. Push up your work when it works, and make a pull request. Please include a detailed note of what you added or changed and why.

If it all looks good, you can expect gratitude and a happy merging.
